        <h3 style={{width: "750px"}}>I am from West Virginia and attended West Virginia University. 
            Shortly after Graduation, I moved out to Denver, CO where I started my career as a Civil Engineer.<br></br> 
            After six years, I chose to take my talents to Flatiron School in Denver and learn software engineering.<br></br>
            I am now energized and excited for the road ahead!</h3>
